# Iron Emblem

Iron Emblem is a tactical multiplayer game, heavily inspired in the classic Fire Emblem games. The objective of the game
is to defeat all your opponent's units.

## How to play

At the start of the game each player can choose a faction between Trolls, Knights and Goblins. Every faction has
different strengths and weakness. Player 1 would start the match every time. Each player has two actions per turn,
movement or attack, and it is possible to use the two actions on the same unit.

Every time a unit is attacked it will receive damage and when its health reach zero it will die and disappear from the
map.

The player who killed all the opponentâ€™s units first will win.
